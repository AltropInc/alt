# Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where you can to create a new class from an existing class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of members. The class which is newly created is known as the **subclass** or **derived class** of the existing class on which the new class is based. and the existing class is the **superclass** or **base class** of the newly created class. The relationship between a derived class and a base class is an [**is-a** relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a). A subclass is a **subtype** of its base, i.e. any instance of a subclass is also an instance of its base.

## Single Inheritance

In Altro, each class can only be derived from one existing base class. This is called **single inheritance**.You use the keyword `is` or colon to identify the base class that your subclass is derived. If you donâ€™t declare a superclass, your class is implicitly based on the class `Object`. `Object` is the root of a subclass tree for all objects created in Altro. However, `Object` is not the ultimate root. The ultimate root in the entire class hierarchy is the type `any` that includes [built-in classes](PrimitiveTypes.md) that are not explicitly defined in Altro.

The syntax of using inheritance in Altro is:
```Altro
class BaseClass
{
    //class members
}
class DerivedClass is BaseClass
{
    // override some members in BaseClass
    // more class members
}
```
A concrete example:
```Altro
class Person
{
    name: string;
    age: int;
    address: string;
}
class Student is Person
{
    grade: int;
    school: string;
}
```
In the above code, when an object of `Student` is created, all class members in the superclass `Person` (the declared values held by `name`, `age`, and `address`) are inherited by the `Student` object, so that we can access these values in the superclass by using the object of the subclass:
```Altro
object JohnSmith is Student
{
    name = "John Smith";
    age = 17;
    address = "740 Place, Town 12345";
    grade = 9;
    school = "Town High Scool";
}
```

## Shadowing

Though names declared in the base class is accessible in derived class, the derived class can intruduce a new member with a name that is alread used in the base class, then the  new member shadows the one with the same name in the base class. For example:
```Altro
class Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "Occupation: " }
}
class Student is Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "Student" }
}
```
If we use a student reference to call `occupation`, the returned value will be "Student":
```Altro
s := Student();
s_occupation := s.occupation();    // s_occupation gets "Student"
```
This is because the function `occupation` defined in `Student` **shadows** the function `occupation` defined in `Person`. If we need to call `occupation` defined in `Person` by using a student reference, we need to use the scope selector to explicitly refers the function defined in `Person`:
```Altro
s := Student();
s_occupation := s.Person::occupation() + s.occupation(); // s_occupation gets "Occupation: Student"
```
For the same reason, we need to use the scope selector within the body of the derived class to access any shadowed name declared in the base class:
```Altro
class Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "Occupation: " }
}
class Student is Person
{
    func occupation(): string { Person::occupation() + "Student" }
}
```

## Overriding

Back to the Person-Student example:
```Altro
class Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "unset" }
}
class Student is Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "Student" }
}
```
When we use a name reference of `Person` to call `occupation`, the function `occupation` defined in `Person` will be called even if the name reference refers to a student:
```Altro
p: Person = Student();
p_occupation := p.occupation();    // p_occupation gets "unset"
```
This is because the funtion `occupation` defined in `Person` and the one defined in `Student` belong to two distinct funtion classes. When we use a name reference of `Person` to call `occupation`, we explicitly calls the one defined in `Person`.

What if we want to call the function defined in a derived class through a base reference? This is the mechanism of **overriding**. When the function of the same name defined in a derived class, it overrides the implementation of the same function defined in the base class. To make this happen, we just need to define the function in the base virtual, meaning, overridable:
```Altro
class Person
{
    virtual func occupation(): string { "unset" }
}
class Student is Person
{
    override func occupation(): string { "Student" }
}
```
Then,
```Altro
p: Person = Student();
p_occupation := p.occupation();
```
`p_occupation` will get the value of "Student". This overriding mechanism allows [subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) in which a name of a superclass can denote instances possibly in many different subclasses and can be used to access members actually defined in the subclass that is the type of the current instance denoted by the name.

## Finalizing

In the overriding example, the keyword `override` ensures that the function `occupation` is virtual in the superclass `Person`. The program is ill-formed if this is not true from the superclass class and a compile-time error is generated. However, the keyword `override` is optional, the function `occupation` will always override the virtual one in the superclass if they have the matched interfaces:
```Altro
class Person
{
    virtual func occupation(): string { "unset" }
}
class Student is Person
{
    func occupation(): string { "Student" }  // still overrides without presenting 'override'
}
```
So then we come to the question of how to stop overriding of a virtual function in a subclass. This can be achieved by subg the keyword `final`. 


Please note the difference between shadowing and overriding. In shadowing, the members with the same name in subclass and superclass are different entities so the subclass can use the name freely for any other purpose. But in overriding, the members with the same name in subclass and superclass are the same entity so the subclass must use the name following certain rules in order to achieve overriding.

Please also note the difference between overloading and overriding. Overloading is a kind of [ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) in which a [function class](FunctionClass) can have multiple interfaces (functions), and which interface to use in a function call is determined by the actual parameters provided in the function call. This ad hoc polymorphism is resolved statically during compile time. Overriding is a kind of [subtype polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) in which one interface of a [function class](FunctionClass) can have multiple implementations in different subclasses, and which implementation to use in a function call is determined by the actual type of the object that owns the function call. This subtype polymorphism is resolved dynamically at run time.


A member class can have a virtual constructor interface defined in the base class that can be overridden in a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a variable declared in the base class, you can use the virtual constructor interface for that object and execute the overridden version of the constructor in derived class to create a member object.

The virtual constructor interface can only be used for member classes derived from a sealed class, and the overridden process is done through their enclosing class hierarchy. Since the member class is derived from a sealed class, only simple class form can be used for virtual member interface:

```altscript
class base
{
  virtual func print()
  {
     // print base class information
  }
};
class derived: base
{
  virtual func print()
  {
     // print derived class information
  }
}; 
```

A member class can have a deferred virtual constructor interface, which is a virtual constructor interface without the implementation block:

```altscript
class abstract_base
{
  deferred func print();
};
class derived: abstract_base
{
  func print()
  {
     // print derived class information
  }
};
```

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. If a class contains a member class with any deferred constructor interface, this class is an abstract class. If its derived class does not override this deferred constructor interface with an implementation block, the derived class is an abstract  class too. In the above example, the class `abstract_base` and `abstract_derived` are abstract classes, and only the class `derived` can be used to instantiate objects. A class can also be declared abstract using the keyword `abstract` even though it does not have any member classes with deferred constructor interfaces. In addition, a parametric class (see [Parametric Class](@ref man-parametric-classes)) is also an abstract class. In summary, a class is abstract if

 * It contains a member class with any deferred constructor interface or inherits such interface that is not overriden
 * It is declared abstract using the keyword `abstract`.
 * It is a parametric class (see [Parametric Class](@ref man-parametric-classes))

The ALT virtual constructor interface is more general than the concept of virtual functions in other traditional programming languages, because the overriding mechanism is not just limited to functions:

```altscript
sealed class sealed_base
{
}
class base
{
    deferred sealed_base member (x: int);
}
object derived is base    // a singleton derived from base
{
    sealed_base member(x: int)
    {
    }
}
x: base = derived;   // a polymorphic variable of 'base' and it actually refers to the 'derived' object
enter ()
{
    x.member(3);     // create a 'member' object in the 'derived' object using the constructor provided in the 'derived' object
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance with Interface Classes

In Multiple Inheritance, one child or subclass class can have more than one base class or superclass and inherit features from every parent class which it inherits. Altro achieves multiple inheritances only with the help of **interface classes**.

A class can be declared as an interface class using the keyword `interface`. An interface class can only have member classes with deferred [functor](Functor.md) interfaces, although the keyword `deferred` is not required in an interface class.


cannot have any member object/value declaration. It cannot have any constructor or destructor either. An interface class can only have member classes with deferred virtual constructor interfaces, although the keyword `deferred` is not required: 

```altscript
interface class ButtonInterface
{
   func onButtonPress();
   func onButtonRelease();
};
```

The interface of member class (function) `onButtonClick` is deferred and does not have implementation. An interface class is an abstract class because all member class constructor interfaces are deferred.

An interface class can inherit multiple interfaces (multiple bases). However, an interface class cannot be inherited by non-interface derived classes, it can only be implemented by non-interface derived classes:

```altscript
class Drawable2DButton is Drawable2D implements ButtonInterface
{
   func onButtonPress()
   {
   }
   func onButtonRelease();
   {
   }
};
class Drawable3DButton is Drawable3D implements ButtonInterface
{
   func onButtonPress()
   {
   }
   func onButtonRelease();
   {
   }
};
```

A derived class can have only one base class by inheritance but can implement multiple interfaces. The derived class is a subclass of its base class, and also a subclass of any interface class that is implemented. `Drawable2DButton` is a subclass of `Drawable2D` and is also a subclass of `ButtonInterface`.

Example of an derived object (singleton) that inherits one base and implements two interfaces:

```altscript
sealed class sealed_base
{
    y: int;
    z: int;
}
interface class interface1
{
    deferred sealed_base member1 (x: int)
}
interface class interface2
{
    deferred sealed_base member2 (x: int)
}
object derived is Drawable implements interface1, interface2
{
    sealed_base member1(x: int)
    {
        y = x;
    }
    sealed_base member2(x: int)
    {
        z = x;
    }
}
x1: interface1 = derived;
x2: interface2 = derived;
enter ()
{
    x1.member1(3);
    x2.member2(4);
}
```



## Inheritance in Parametric Class




## self, selfclass, owner, ownerclass

The keyword `self` is the reserved object name used within a class body to represent the actual instance created by this class or by a derived class of this class. It is similar to Java's `this` reference or C++'s `this` pointer. However, there is a major distinction: `self` appearing in a function body refers to the instance of the function instead of the instance of the class that encloses the function. The reason for this distinction is that ALT treats a member function the same as a member class. The function body is just a simple form of member class. To access the instance of the class that encloses the function within the function body, use the keyword `owner`, which is the reserved object name to represent the enclosing object of the `self` instance.

The keyword `selfclass` represents the actual type of the instance represented by  `self`. Therefore, `selfclass` appearing in a class body may refer to the type of this class or a subclass of this class. The keyword `ownerclass` represents the actual type of the instance represented by `owner`.
