# Loop Statements

Loop statement is a feature that facilitates the execution of a piece of code repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Altro provides four types of loop statements:

* While loop
* Repeat loop
* For loop
* Foreach loop

## The `while` Loop

The while loop is a pre-tested loop. It is used in situations where the number of iterations is unknown at first. The block of statements is executed in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop become unsatisfied, and thereafter, the loop ends and the execution flow moves to the next statement after the loop. The while loop ahs the following sytax:

**while** (*expression*) *statement*

The expression is the condition expression and must be evaluated to a boolean value. The statement followed will repeated as long as the condition expression is re-evaluated to true.

## The `repeat` Loop

## The `for` Loop

## The `foreach` Loop
